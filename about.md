# Ideals

We want to build solidarity across borders by offering a virtual space where people can engage with fellow comrades. We teach each other, we learn from each other and we entertain each other. We believe our revolution should be fun :D.

# Goals

- Connect with people who have similar ideals as we do. And be lighthearted :D
